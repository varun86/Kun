  reply, mirror, fallback, and per-channel failure behavior.

- [x] 4.4 Extract Feishu transport adapter.
- [x] 4.5 Extract Telegram transport adapter.

- [x] 4.7 Reduce `ClawRuntime` to channel coordination and remove platform branches
  from common conversation logic.

## 5. Renderer event projection

- [x] 5.1 Capture live, replay, reconnect, duplicate completion, approval/user-input,
  child-agent, goal/todo, and workspace-refresh projections.
- [x] 5.2 Introduce normalized runtime projection action types.
- [x] 5.3 Extract pure item/event-to-action normalization from `kun-mapper`.
- [x] 5.4 Extract a pure chat projection reducer shared by live SSE and replay.
- [x] 5.5 Represent notifications, reconnect, reload, mirror, and workspace refresh as
  explicit effect commands with once-only tests.
- [x] 5.6 Reduce `chat-store-runtime` and `kun-mapper` to wiring/facade roles.

## 6. Workflow execution and configuration

- [x] 6.1 Capture graph order, branching, retries, approval, cancellation, timeout,
  schedule, hook, and single-node execution transcripts.
- [x] 6.2 Extract graph planner and validated execution plan types.
- [x] 6.3 Extract run coordinator and terminal-state/cancellation ownership.
- [x] 6.4 Introduce a typed node executor registry and move AI, HTTP, condition,
  transform, delay, and integration node families behind adapters.
- [x] 6.5 Extract workflow scheduler and live-status projection.
- [x] 6.6 Split `NodeConfigPanel` into node-family editors with shared binding and
  validation components.
- [ ] 6.7 Reduce `WorkflowRuntime` and the shared panel to composition facades.

## 7. Hybrid thread persistence

- [x] 7.1 Add golden existing-data fixtures covering SQLite index, JSONL history,
  legacy threads, backfill, archive/search, and usage recovery.
- [ ] 7.2 Extract thread index repository and query/summary mapping.
- [ ] 7.3 Extract thread document/legacy readers and recovery precedence.
- [x] 7.4 Extract thread projection assembler and turn/item merge rules.
- [ ] 7.5 Extract backfill coordination and lifecycle/error reporting.
- [ ] 7.6 Reduce `HybridThreadStore` to the `ThreadStore` facade and prove persisted
  schema and files remain unchanged.

## 8. Workbench UI composition

- [ ] 8.1 Characterize Composer draft, attachment, mention, keyboard, menu,
  model/reasoning, capacity, send, and focus behavior.
- [ ] 8.2 Extract Composer draft/attachment/file-mention hooks and focused views.
- [ ] 8.3 Extract Composer model/reasoning/menu/capacity owners and preserve the
  public props contract.
- [ ] 8.4 Characterize Sidebar grouping, worktree resolution, drag/drop, preview,
  draft history, menus, and selection behavior.
- [ ] 8.5 Extract deterministic Sidebar selectors and focused project/thread/draft
  components.
- [ ] 8.6 Verify keyboard-only and accessibility behavior for extracted UI.

## 9. Settings domain contract

- [ ] 9.1 Inventory every persisted settings field across shared types, defaults,
  normalization, migration, IPC schemas, presets, and UI patches.
- [ ] 9.2 Establish canonical domain modules for provider/Kun/runtime settings rules.
- [ ] 9.3 Route IPC schemas and main consumers through canonical normalizers.
- [ ] 9.4 Route provider and agent settings UI patches through canonical helpers and
  split node-size settings sections into focused panels.
- [ ] 9.5 Verify all supported legacy settings fixtures normalize and save to the same
  current shape without restoring legacy runtimes.

## 10. Final compatibility and health audit

- [ ] 10.1 Run focused tests and build/typecheck after every extraction increment.
- [ ] 10.2 Run the full Kun and root test suites, typechecks, lint, and production
  build, documenting unrelated concurrent failures separately.
- [ ] 10.3 Compare public exports, HTTP/SSE schemas, provider wire transcripts, tool
  schemas/cache prefix, persisted files, and saved settings against the baseline.
- [ ] 10.4 Perform local runtime startup/health/shutdown and core Code/Design/Write/
  Connect smoke checks appropriate to the available environment.
- [ ] 10.5 Confirm each former S/A hotspot has a narrow owner, no duplicated active
  path, adequate characterization coverage, and a documented remaining risk.
